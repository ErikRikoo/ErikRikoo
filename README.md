### Hello there üëã

I am Erik Kubiak, a game developper with a focus on Unity.
I particularly love writing graphics features and tools.
You will find some in these repositories:
- [Editor Utilities](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/com.rikoo.editor-utilities), which contains some useful stuff when you do tooling in Unity.
- [Interface Utilities](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/com.rikoo.interface-utilities), which help you to use interface in Unity.
- [UI Post Process](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/Unity-UI-Post-Process) allows you to apply a post process to a world space UI.
- [Dynamic Color Palette](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/Unity-Dynamic-Color-Palette) is an utility tool that allows you to create dynamic color palette. Thus if you modify the original color it will also update all the elements.
- [Text Position Randomizer](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/Unity-Text-Position-Randomizer) is a try on customising TextMeshPro. It will allow you to randomize the character position in the view.

All these tools are still WIP and not completely documentated but I will come back to them soon üòâ

I also work on a video game project on my free time: [Dead Signs](http://deadsigns.fr/). I still have a strong focus on graphics and tooling but I also work on gameplay.
The shaders and the graphics tools are in public repository but some stuff are still private:
- [Shaders](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/com.rikoo.dead-signs-shader)
- [Graphic tools](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/com.rikoo.deadsigns-hdrp-utils)

As I love programming games, I did my first gamejam this summer, the GMTK. The [code](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/GMTK-2021) is public and you can play [there](https://rikoo.itch.io/late-gmtk-2021). This game is far from being perfect as we hadn't the opportunity to book the complete week-end. But we may get back to it soon to also improve the game design. During this jam, we developped a good "framework" for interactabilty in Unity and I extracted it [there](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/com.rikoo.triggerable).

I love learning new things and  for now I am learning 3D modeling and the Tech Art which is pretty thrilling.

You can find all the way to reach me directly on my portfolio üòÅ
