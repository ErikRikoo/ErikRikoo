### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Erik Kubiak, a game developper with a focus on Unity.
I particularly love writing  gameplay or graphics features and tools.
You will find some in these repositories:
- [Editor Utilities](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/com.rikoo.editor-utilities), which contains some useful stuff when you do tooling in Unity.
- [Interface Utilities](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/com.rikoo.interface-utilities), which help you to use interface in Unity.
- [UI Post Process](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/Unity-UI-Post-Process) allows you to apply a post process to a world space UI.
- [Dynamic Color Palette](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/Unity-Dynamic-Color-Palette) is an utility tool that allows you to create dynamic color palette. Thus if you modify the original color it will also update all the elements.
- [Text Position Randomizer](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/Unity-Text-Position-Randomizer) is a try on customising TextMeshPro. It will allow you to randomize the character position in the view.

All these tools are still WIP and not completely documentated but I will come back to them soon ðŸ˜‰

I also work on a video game project on my free time: [Dead Signs](http://deadsigns.fr/). (For now the project is under pause) I still have a strong focus on graphics and tooling but I also work on gameplay.
The shaders and the graphics tools are in public repository but some stuff are still private:
- [Shaders](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/com.rikoo.dead-signs-shader)
- [Graphic tools](https://github.com/ErikRikoo/com.rikoo.deadsigns-hdrp-utils)

As I love gameplay programming, I do jams quite often and can play my games on my [itch.io](https://rikoo.itch.io/). Even on short time, I always have a clear vision of the project and architcture that allows me to often be the "lead Developer" and keep a nice and SOLID code. 
I am also working on side projects and I am currently working on a puzzle game on my free time that will be soon announced.

I love learning new things and for now I am learning 3D modeling and the the Tech Art field and you can check my [twitter](https://twitter.com/KubiakErik) or my [Art Station](https://www.artstation.com/erikkubiak).

I am a really curious game developper who loves learning new things and that in any field.
